    "Q1. Class and Object in Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "Class: A blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object: An instance of a class. It represents an individual \"thing\" that has the properties and behaviors defined by its class.\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand, model, year):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        self.year = year\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def display_info(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Brand: {self.brand}, Model: {self.model}, Year: {self.year}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an object of the Car class\n",
    "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2020)\n",
    "my_car.display_info()  # Output: Brand: Toyota, Model: Corolla, Year: 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Four Pillars of OOP\n",
    "Encapsulation: Bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: A mechanism where a new class inherits attributes and methods from an existing class. This helps in reusability and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. It allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: The concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It simplifies the interaction with the object by exposing only the necessary parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. The __init__() Function\n",
    "The __init__() function is a special method in Python classes. It is the constructor method that gets called automatically when an instance (object) of the class is created. It allows the class to initialize the attributes of the object.\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def display(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an object of the Person class\n",
    "person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
    "person1.display()  # Output: Name: Alice, Age: 30\n",
    "Q4. Why self is Used in OOP\n",
    "The self keyword is used in instance methods to refer to the instance of the class. It is used to access variables that belong to the class. The first parameter of any instance method is self, which allows the method to refer to the calling instance.\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, species):\n",
    "        self.species = species\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def make_sound(self, sound):\n",
    "        print(f\"The {self.species} says {sound}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an object of the Animal class\n",
    "dog = Animal(\"Dog\")\n",
    "dog.make_sound(\"Woof\")  # Output: The Dog says Woof\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Inheritance in OOP\n",
    "Inheritance: A mechanism in which one class inherits attributes and methods from another class. This promotes code reuse and establishes a natural hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",

    "Single Inheritance: A class inherits from one superclass.\n",
