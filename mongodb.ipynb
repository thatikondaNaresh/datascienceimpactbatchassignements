    ". MongoDB and Non-Relational Databases\n",
    "MongoDB:\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.\n",
    "Non-Relational Databases: Non-relational databases (NoSQL databases) do not use the traditional tabular structure of relational databases. They offer flexible schemas and are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data efficiently.\n",
    "Scenarios to Prefer MongoDB:\n",
    "Flexible Schema: When the schema of data is not predefined and can evolve over time.\n",
    "Scalability: MongoDB is horizontally scalable, making it suitable for handling large-scale applications and big data.\n",
    "Document-Oriented: If your application deals with complex data structures or hierarchical data, MongoDB's document-oriented model is beneficial.\n",
    "Fast Development: For rapid prototyping or agile development where changes in data models are frequent.\n",
    "Q2. Features of MongoDB\n",
    "Features:\n",
    "Schemaless: Documents in MongoDB do not require a predefined schema, allowing flexibility in data models.\n",
    "High Performance: Supports high throughput and low latency operations due to efficient indexing and query optimization.\n",
    "Horizontal Scalability: Scales horizontally by sharding, distributing data across multiple servers.\n",
    "Document-Oriented: Stores data in JSON-like BSON (Binary JSON) documents, supporting nested data structures.\n",
    "Rich Query Language: Supports rich queries using MongoDB Query Language (MQL), including aggregation pipeline for advanced analytics.\n",
    "High Availability: Supports replica sets for automatic failover and data redundancy.\n",
    "Indexing: Provides efficient indexing support to optimize query performance.\n",
    "Q3. Connecting MongoDB to Python and Creating Database and Collection\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "# Establish connection to MongoDB\n",
    "myclient = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a database\n",
    "mydb = myclient[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a collection\n",
    "mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]\n",
    "Q4. Inserting Records and Using find() and find_one() Methods\n",
    "# Insert one record\n",
    "record = {\"name\": \"John\", \"address\": \"Highway 37\"}\n",
    "inserted_one = mycol.insert_one(record)\n",
    "print(\"Inserted ID:\", inserted_one.inserted_id)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert many records\n",
    "records = [\n",
    "  {\"name\": \"Peter\", \"address\": \"Lowstreet 27\"},\n",

    "  {\"name\": \"Chuck\", \"address\": \"Main Road 989\"},\n",
    "  {\"name\": \"Viola\", \"address\": \"Sideway 1633\"}\n",
    "]\n",
    "inserted_many = mycol.insert_many(records)\n",
    "print(\"Inserted IDs:\", inserted_many.inserted_ids)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using find_one() to retrieve one record\n",
    "result_one = mycol.find_one({\"name\": \"John\"})\n",
    "print(\"Find One Result:\", result_one)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using find() to retrieve all records\n",
    "result_all = mycol.find()\n",
    "for document in result_all:\n",
    "    print(document)\n",
    "Q5. Using find() Method to Query MongoDB\n",
    "find() Method: The find() method in MongoDB is used to query documents from a collection based on specified criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "# Querying documents with a specific condition\n",
    "results = mycol.find({\"address\": \"Park Lane 38\"})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Printing the results\n",
    "for document in results:\n",
    "    print(document)\n",
    "Q6. Explanation of sort() Method in MongoDB\n",
    "sort() Method: The sort() method in MongoDB is used to sort the results of a query in ascending or descending order based on one or more fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sorting documents by 'name' field in ascending order\n",
    "results = mycol.find().sort(\"name\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Printing sorted results\n",
    "for document in results:\n",
    "    print(document)\n",
    "Q7. Usage of delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() in MongoDB\n",
    "delete_one(filter): Deletes a single document matching the filter criteria.\n",
    "mycol.delete_one({\"name\": \"John\"})\n",
    "delete_many(filter): Deletes all documents matching the filter criteria.\n",
    "mycol.delete_many({\"address\": {\"$regex\": \"^S\"}})\n",
    "drop(): Deletes the entire collection, including all its documents.\n",
    "mycol.drop()\n",
    "These methods are used to remove documents or entire collections from the MongoDB database based on specified criteria or to delete the entire collection altogether.\n",
