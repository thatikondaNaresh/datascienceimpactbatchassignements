    "1. Explain GET and POST Methods\n",
    "GET Method:\n",
    "Purpose: The GET method is used to request data from a specified resource.\n",
    "Characteristics:\n",
    "Safe and Idempotent: GET requests should not change the state of the server. They are safe and idempotent, meaning multiple identical GET requests will produce the same result.\n",
    "Data in URL: Data is sent in the URL query string (e.g., ?name=John&age=30).\n",
    "Limitations: Limited to 2048 characters in URLs.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "http\n",
    "GET /user?name=John&age=30 HTTP/1.1\n",
    "Host: example.com\n",
    "POST Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: The POST method is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource.\n",
    "Characteristics:\n",
    "Not Safe: POST requests can modify server state and are not idempotent.\n",
    "Data in Body: Data is sent in the body of the request, making it suitable for sending large amounts of data.\n",
    "Flexible Data: Can include files, JSON, form data, etc.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "http\n",
    "\n",
    "POST /user HTTP/1.1\n",
    "Host: example.com\n",
    "Content-Type: application/json\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"name\": \"John\",\n",
    "  \"age\": 30\n",
    "}\n",
    "Q2. Why is request Used in Flask?\n",
    "Purpose: The request object in Flask is used to handle incoming HTTP requests. It provides access to data sent by the client, such as form data, query parameters, headers, and cookies.\n",
    "Usage: You use request to read data from the incoming request and to get information like request method, form data, JSON payload, etc.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "from flask import Flask, request\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def login():\n",
    "    username = request.form['username']\n",
    "    password = request.form['password']\n",
    "    return f'Logged in as {username}'\n",
    "Q3. Why is redirect() Used in Flask?\n",
    "Purpose: The redirect() function in Flask is used to redirect the client to a different URL. It is commonly used after form submission or to redirect to another page.\n",
    "Usage: redirect() is used to send a 302 HTTP status code to the client, instructing it to navigate to the specified URL.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def index():\n",
    "    return 'Home Page'\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/login')\n",
    "def login():\n",
    "    return redirect(url_for('index'))\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "Q4. What are Templates in Flask? Why is render_template() Used?\n",
    "Templates in Flask:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Templates in Flask are HTML files with placeholders for dynamic content. They allow developers to separate the presentation layer from the business logic.\n",
    "Purpose: Templates enable the generation of dynamic HTML content by rendering data passed from the Flask application.\n",
    "Usage of render_template():\n",
    "\n",
    "Function: render_template() is used to render a template file with the provided data. It simplifies the process of combining static HTML with dynamic content.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "from flask import Flask, render_template\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def home():\n",
    "    return render_template('home.html', title=\"Welcome\", message=\"Hello, Flask!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "Example home.html Template:\n",
    "\n",
