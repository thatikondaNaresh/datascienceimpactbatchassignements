    "The Probability Density Function (PDF) is a function that describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a particular value.

    "Specifically, the data in the tails (both the left tail and right tail) are the least frequent, as the normal distribution is symmetrical around the mean and becomes increasingly rare as it moves further away from the mean."
