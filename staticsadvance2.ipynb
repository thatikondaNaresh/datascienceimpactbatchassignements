    "Q1: What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with an example.\n",
    "Probability Mass Function (PMF): This is used for discrete random variables and gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value. Mathematically, for a discrete random variable \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider rolling a fair six-sided die. The PMF for this scenario would give the probability of rolling each possible number from 1 to 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability Density Function (PDF): This is used for continuous random variables and describes the relative likelihood for a continuous random variable to take on a given value. For a continuous random variable \n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?\n",
    "Cumulative Density Function (CDF): This function gives the probability that a random variable \n",
    "F(x)=P(X‚â§x).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: For a fair six-sided die, the CDF would give the cumulative probabilities of rolling 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance: CDF is used to understand the distribution of a random variable over its entire range. It provides a complete picture of how likely values are distributed across the variable's range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: What are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model? Explain how the parameters of the normal distribution relate to the shape of the distribution.\n",
    "The normal distribution is used as a model in many real-world situations where the data tends to cluster around a central value with no bias towards left or right tails. Some examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Heights or weights of people in a large population.\n",
    "Measurement errors.\n",
    "IQ scores.\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean (\n",
    "ùúá\n",

    "Standard Deviation (\n",
    "ùúé\n",
    "œÉ): Measures the spread or dispersion of the data around the mean.\n",
    "The shape of the normal distribution is bell-shaped and symmetrical around the mean. The spread (standard deviation) controls how wide or narrow the bell curve is, while the mean shifts the entire curve left or right along the x-axis.\n",
    "Q4: Explain the importance of Normal Distribution. Give a few real-life examples of Normal Distribution.\n",
    "Importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal distribution is important because many natural processes and measurements tend to follow this distribution.\n",
    "It simplifies statistical analysis because its properties are well-understood.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Heights of people in a population.\n",
    "IQ scores in a large group of people.\n",
    "Measurement errors in scientific experiments.\n",
    "Q5: What is Bernoulli Distribution? Give an Example. What is the difference between Bernoulli Distribution and Binomial Distribution?\n",
    "Bernoulli Distribution: It represents the probability distribution of a random variable which takes the value 1 with probability \n",
    "Example: A coin toss can be modeled using Bernoulli distribution, where \n",

    "\n",
    "Difference:\n",

    "Bernoulli Distribution: Describes a single trial with two possible outcomes (success or failure).\n",
    "Binomial Distribution: Describes the number of successes (yes/no outcomes) in a fixed number of independent trials.\n",
    "Q6: Consider a dataset with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. If we assume that the dataset is normally distributed, what is the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater than 60? Use the appropriate formula and show your calculations.\n",

    "0.1587\n",
    "P(X>60)=P(Z>1)=1‚àí0.8413=0.1587\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the probability that a randomly selected observation from this dataset is greater than 60 is approximately \n",
    "0.1587\n",
    "0.1587 or \n",
    "15.87\n",
    "%\n",
    "15.87%.\n",

    "Q7: Explain Uniform Distribution with an example.\n",
    "Uniform Distribution: This distribution occurs when all outcomes or values in a range are equally likely to occur. It's characterized by a constant probability density function over a given range.\n",

    "Z Score: The z score (or standard score) measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean of a dataset. It's calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance: Z scores are important because they:\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardize data, allowing for comparison across different datasets.\n",
    "Help determine how unusual or typical a particular data point is within a distribution.\n",
    "Aid in hypothesis testing and inferential statistics by providing a reference point for normal distribution.\n",
    "Q9: What is Central Limit Theorem? State the significance of the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "Central Limit Theorem (CLT): The CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. It's a fundamental concept in statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Significance: The CLT is significant because:\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows us to use normal distribution assumptions for many statistical analyses, even when the population distribution is not normal.\n",
    "It forms the basis for inferential statistics, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals.\n",
