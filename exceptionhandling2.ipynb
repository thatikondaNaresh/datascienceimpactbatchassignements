    "Q1. Using the Exception Class for Custom Exceptions\n",
    "The Exception class in Python is the base class for all built-in exceptions. When creating custom exceptions, it is important to inherit from the Exception class because it provides the necessary functionality to handle exceptions correctly within Python's exception-handling framework. Inheriting from Exception ensures that your custom exceptions will behave like standard exceptions, can be caught using except blocks, and will integrate seamlessly with existing exception handling mechanisms.\n",

    "Q2. Python Exception Hierarchy\n",
    "import inspect\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_exception_hierarchy(cls, level=0):\n",

    "print_exception_hierarchy(BaseException)\n",
    "This program prints the hierarchy of exceptions starting from BaseException.\n",

    "Q3. ArithmeticError Class\n",
    "The ArithmeticError class is the base class for all errors that occur for numeric calculations. Errors defined under ArithmeticError include:\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: Raised when division or modulo by zero occurs.\n",
    "OverflowError: Raised when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be represented.\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError Example:\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"ZeroDivisionError caught: {e}\")\n",

    "# Output:\n",
    "# OverflowError caught: math range error\n",
    "Q4. LookupError Class\n",
    "The LookupError class is the base class for errors raised when a lookup on a collection (e.g., list, dictionary) fails. Two common subclasses are KeyError and IndexError.\n",

    "Q6. Best Practices for Exception Handling in Python\n",
    "Use Specific Exceptions: Catch specific exceptions instead of using a general except clause. This makes the code more readable and easier to debug.\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Caught an exception: {e}\")\n",
    "Avoid Bare Except Clauses: Avoid using a bare except: clause which catches all exceptions, making debugging difficult.\n",

    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Caught an exception: {e}\")\n",

    "try:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    file.close()\n",
    "Use with Statement for Resource Management: The with statement ensures proper acquisition and release of resources.\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "Provide Useful Error Messages: Provide informative error messages to help debug issues.\n",
    "try:\n",

    "    if value < 0:\n",
    "        raise CustomError(\"Value cannot be negative.\")\n",

    "except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "    logging.error(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "Do Not Suppress Exceptions: Avoid using pass in except blocks which suppresses exceptions without any handling or logging.\n",

    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
