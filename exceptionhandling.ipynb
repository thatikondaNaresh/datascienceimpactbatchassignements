    "1. Exception in Python and Syntax Errors\n",
    "Exception: An event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. Exceptions are errors that occur due to code issues, runtime conditions, etc., and can be handled using try-except blocks.\n",
    "Syntax Error: Errors caused by not following the correct syntax of the language. These errors are detected before the program is run.\n",
    "Difference:\n",
    "Exception: Occurs during runtime, can be handled using try-except blocks.\n",
    "Syntax Error: Detected by the interpreter before the program runs, cannot be handled using try-except blocks.\n",
