    "Q1. Multithreading in Python\n",
    "Multithreading in Python refers to the ability of a process to manage its tasks by executing multiple threads concurrently. Each thread runs independently, allowing different parts of the program to be executed simultaneously. It is used to achieve concurrent execution and improve performance by utilizing multiple CPUs or CPU cores efficiently.\n",
    "Module Used: The module used to handle threads in Python is threading.\n",
    "Why Threading Module: The threading module provides a high-level interface for creating and managing threads in Python. It simplifies the process of working with threads by abstracting the underlying operating system's thread implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions in threading Module:\n",
    "\n",
    "activeCount(): Returns the number of Thread objects currently alive.\n",
    "currentThread(): Returns the current Thread object.\n",
    "enumerate(): Returns a list of all Thread objects currently alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Functions in Threading Module\n",
    "run(): Defines the code to be executed by a thread when started.\n",
    "start(): Starts the execution of a thread by invoking its run() method.\n",
    "join(timeout=None): Waits for the thread to complete its execution. If timeout is specified, it waits for at most timeout seconds.\n",
    "isAlive(): Returns True if the thread is alive (i.e., started and not terminated), otherwise returns False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Example Python Program with Two Threads\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_squares():\n",
    "    for i in range(1, 6):\n",
    "        print(f\"Square of {i}: {i*i}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_cubes():\n",
    "    for i in range(1, 6):\n",
    "        print(f\"Cube of {i}: {i*i*i}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create threads\n",
    "thread1 = threading.Thread(target=print_squares)\n",
    "thread2 = threading.Thread(target=print_cubes)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start threads\n",
    "thread1.start()\n",
    "thread2.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wait for threads to complete\n",
    "thread1.join()\n",
    "thread2.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Threads finished execution.\")\n",
    "Q4. Advantages and Disadvantages of Multithreading\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrency: Allows concurrent execution of tasks, improving overall performance by utilizing CPU resources effectively.\n",
    "Responsiveness: Helps maintain responsiveness in applications, especially in GUI applications or servers handling multiple requests.\n",
    "Resource Sharing: Threads within the same process share memory, making data sharing easier and faster than inter-process communication.\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Multithreading introduces complexity due to issues such as race conditions and synchronization.\n",
    "Overhead: Thread creation and management have overhead, and improper management can lead to resource contention.\n",
    "Difficulty in Debugging: Debugging multithreaded programs can be challenging due to non-deterministic behavior and timing issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Deadlocks and Race Conditions\n",
    "Deadlock:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting on a resource held by the other thread(s). This typically happens in concurrent programming when two threads acquire locks in a different order.\n",
    "Example: Thread A locks Resource X and waits for Resource Y. At the same time, Thread B locks Resource Y and waits for Resource X. Both threads will wait indefinitely, causing a deadlock.\n",
    "Race Condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: A race condition occurs when multiple threads or processes access shared data and attempt to change it at the same time. The final outcome depends on the timing of how the threads are scheduled.\n",
    "Example: Two threads incrementing a shared variable counter simultaneously without synchronization can lead to unpredictable results, as each thread may read an outdated value and overwrite each other's changes.\n",
    "Both deadlocks and race conditions are common pitfalls in concurrent programming, and they can lead to program crashes, incorrect results, or non-responsive applications. Proper synchronization mechanisms, such as locks or semaphores, are used to prevent these issues in multithreaded environments.\n",
