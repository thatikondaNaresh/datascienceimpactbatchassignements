    "Q1: What is Matplotlib? Why is it used? Name five plots that can be plotted using the Pyplot module of Matplotlib.\n",
    "Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is widely used for plotting graphs and charts because of its ease of use and extensive functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses of Matplotlib:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data visualization for better understanding and insights.\n",
    "Creating publication-quality figures in various formats.\n",
    "Interactive graphing for exploratory data analysis.\n",
    "Customizing plots with a variety of options for fine-tuned control.\n",
    "Integrating plots into applications using object-oriented APIs.\n",
    "Five plots using the Pyplot module of Matplotlib:\n",

    "Line Plot\n",
    "Scatter Plot\n",
    "Bar Plot\n",
    "Histogram\n",
    "Box Plot\n",
    "Q2: What is a scatter plot? Use the following code to generate data for x and y. Using this generated data plot a scatter plot.\n",
    "A scatter plot is a type of plot that displays values for two variables as a collection of points. It is useful for identifying relationships, trends, and patterns between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",

    "Q3: Why is the subplot() function used? Draw four line plots using the subplot() function.\n",
    "The subplot() function in Matplotlib is used to create multiple plots within the same figure. It helps to organize the plots in a grid-like structure, making it easy to compare multiple plots side by side.\n",

    "A bar plot is a chart that presents categorical data with rectangular bars. The lengths of the bars are proportional to the values they represent. Bar plots are used to compare different groups or to track changes over time.\n",

    "A box plot (or box-and-whisker plot) is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on a five-number summary (\"minimum\", first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and \"maximum\"). It is used to identify outliers and understand the spread and skewness of the data.\n",
